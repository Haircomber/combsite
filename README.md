Haircomb Info + Fee Page

The purpose of this project is to provide information about the Haircomb token, along with filling any gaps that the core site does not offer.
The front page is very simple because there's already documentation, whitepaper, etc for deeper info. It allows people to grasp the main purpose of the project in a minute or two.
The site doesn't use any framework or templates, it could definitely use improvements in styling to be more appealing. 
Thanks to Watashi564, the site also offers a fee for claiming without needing to sync. 
The site is currently up at haircomber.com

Goals:

--100% Accurate Fee
Problem:
At the time of writing, March 2024, the fee chart is only 30% accurate. This will cause major issues in the future if there's claim competition, 
because competitors may think they have the highest fee when they don't. They may also bid lower than necessary, losing their funds for no reason.
It also causes problems with getting an accurate price.
Solution:
Since the biggest issue with obtaining fee is the fact that eligible transactions are previously unseen, a database strictly dedicated to holding all p2wsh addresses could solve the issue, 
although there may be other answers. 

--Price
Problem:
The comb price only shows a somewhat accurate price per comb paid in USD if you're looking at your own true claim fee on the chart, because the weight isn't based on what an average claim would be. 
It doesn't currently help people get an idea of how much they should be trading comb for, which is the main purpose of a price.
Solution:
By averaging the final top fee for each block, as well as using the average transaction weight for a true claim transaction, a stable and somewhat accurate comb price can be obtained. The
average could be based on any amount of blocks, but 8-24hours seems most reasonable. There also needs to be a proper BTC price obtained, so the price in USD is accurate. 
A proper price will allow people to have a reference for how much they should trade their comb for, as well as give an opportunity for a market cap of sorts through COMBPRICE x CIRCULATING SUPPLY.

--Supply Stats
Problem:
Aside from no available price, COMB also doesn't have a clear display of the amount of true claims, or real comb, that exists. As most comb so far has been burned from low claim activity, it's
important to have a proper circulating supply. 
Solution:
There's already a list of all claims from pricecharter. By searching the corresponding tx IDs and categorizing winning transactions with 330 or 546 sats, a general idea of true claims and
circulating supply can be obtained.
The Natasha story on the front page could be replaced with Max Supply, Circulating Supply, Burned Supply, Market Cap, etc.

--FAQ, Roadmap, Etc.
It'd be nice if the site stayed simple and most things were outside the landing page, such as how documentation can be found elsewhere on 21teeth and other places, but things like FAQs and Roadmaps could
be added. If the site was to be extended, it may be good to remove the front page titles (quantum resistance, privacy, etc) and replace that section with links or pushdowns to relavant parts of the page for extra info.

--Styling
As said before, the site could use better styling to be more appealing. If it wasn't obvious, it's the first site I've completed, so there's much room for improvement.


Some of these goals are obtainable in a reasonable time for me, but most things are a lot harder for me and won't be finished by myself for a long time. Any help is greatly appreciated, I'd just like these main goals 
to be recognized when making changes. It's free to fork and use however anyone pleases otherwise.
