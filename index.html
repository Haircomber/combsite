            Natasha Otomoski was brushing her hair and thinking about Bitcoin...<br><br> How could privacy and scalibility be improved?<br> Would Bitcoin adapt to handle the looming threat of quantum computing?<br> How could modifications be made without disturbing Bitcoin's delicate process?<br><br> The idea of a unique token emerged as a potential solution â€” <br>leveraging the Bitcoin chain for verification<br> while managing enhancements through off-chain data storage.<br><br> As Natasha looked down at her comb, <br>she realized each of its 21 teeth could represent<br> a piece of this token's post-quantum signature scheme.<br><br> A cryptologic haircomb was born.</div>

            <p>Haircomb's transactions are a permanent redirection of funds, initiated by funding a liquidity stack. Any amount of subsequent stacks can be added without incurring additional fees. <br> This method of transacting could provide a major benefit for bulk payment procedures, such as payrolls.</p>

            <p>By using a varied Winternitz one-time signature scheme, haircomb is set up with post-quantum public/private key encryption. As quantum computing becomes a greater threat to modern encryption, haircomb aims to protect users and even strengthen the entire ledger by providing a post-quantum option on-chain.</p>

            <p>In the haircomb protocol, a Decider acts as a decentralized and automated version of an escrow agent. The Decider holds the funds (trapped in a Merkle Segment) until certain conditions are met, making the final decision and releasing funds based on those conditions. Deciders could bring many types of 3rd party transacting systems to Bitcoin in a safe and decentralized way. </p>

            <p>The top previously unseen p2wsh address of each bitcoin block receives a predetermined and ever-declining amount of comb. (Combbase) This could provide increased mining incentives for bitcoin, while releasing comb in a fair way for everyone.
